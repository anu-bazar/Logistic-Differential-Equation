# Logistic-Differential-Equation
Can mathematical models dictate biological phenomenons?
Done through the Modelling Course in Population and Evolutionary Biology at ELTE under the supervision of Dr. Viktor M, I sought out to investigate if LDE is a dynamic/chaotic system within a deterministic one and if we could simulate a real-time population diversity through simulations in R in a torus-like plane. Did you know that during the initial makings of embedding randomness in computers, the very same logistic equation was used to simulate randomness?

This course is based on the ETH Zurich course of the same name: Modelling Course in Population and Evolutionary Biology.

# The logistic difference equation
Basic problem:
In a external pagevery influential papercall_made in 1976 the Australian theoretical ecologist Robert May showed that simple first order difference equations can have very complicated or even unpredictable dynamics. Here we explore the route into chaotic behaviour using the Logistic Difference Equation (LDE) as a model. In particular, we will address how chaotic dynamics may be characterized.

General approach:
The LDE can be coded in a few lines of R code. This function can then be used to study the dynamic behaviour as a function of the parameter r describing the population growth rate. The dynamical behaviour can be investigated by studying time courses, phase diagrams, and bifurcation diagrams.
What can be learned?

Concepts:
Chaotic dynamics
Periodic dynamics
Bifurcations
Definition of chaos

Methods:
Simulation of simple single-species difference equations
Bifurcation diagrams
Phase diagrams
